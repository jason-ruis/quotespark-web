And in order that this two-fold ministry, to the spiritual and to the physical, may be carried out as effectively as possible, he will also grant that these ministers should themselves see that there is fitting order among themselves, and arrange things so that nothing is omitted in any way, but everything is carried out in the best way for the church and the house of God.

This is taught by the ninth chapter. Also in this chapter the true practice of discipline and penance in the church, as it was ordained by the Lord and maintained for the good of the church by the apostles and ancient holy fathers, and should be instituted and used again by us for the sake of true reformation, was somewhat extensively explained and proved, and all sorts of objections which are raised by some against this practice of discipline and penance were refuted.",

It is often hard to get Christians to see that God is willing not just to use men and women in ministry, but in law, in medicine, in business, in the arts. This is the great shortfall today.”117",

Rather, they are treated as holy and unassailable, and promoted with religious fervor and passion. They are said to bestow happiness and fulfillment (earthly forms of salvation). All people are obliged to serve these ideals, and those who despise them are themselves to be rejected.

He is looking for some extraordinary social experience which he has not found elsewhere; he is bringing muddled and impure desires into Christian brotherhood. Just at this point Christian brotherhood is threatened most often at the very start by the greatest danger of all, the danger of being poisoned at its root, the danger of confusing Christian brotherhood with some wishful idea of religious fellowship, of confounding the natural desire of the devout heart for community with the spiritual reality of Christian brotherhood. In Christian brotherhood everything depends upon its being clear right from the beginning, first, that Christian brotherhood is not an ideal, but a divine reality. Second, that Christian brotherhood is a spiritual and not a psychic reality.",

The more isolated a person is, the more destructive will be the power of sin over him, and the more deeply he becomes involved in it, the more disastrous is his isolation. Sin wants to remain unknown. It shuns the light. In the darkness of the unexpressed it poisons the whole being of a person. This can happen even in the midst of a pious community. In confession the light of the Gospel breaks into the darkness and seclusion of the heart. The sin must be brought into the light. The unexpressed must be openly spoken and acknowledged. All that is secret and hidden is made manifest. It is a hard struggle until the sin is openly admitted. But God breaks gates of brass and bars of iron (Ps 107:16).",

However, each of these ideas is a new belief, a value-laden commitment that can't be empirically proven.

Consider, then, whether you can have peace with God and your own conscience, while persevering in the state wherein you now are...Wherefore, the course which it most befits you to take, is to withdraw before you are plunged so deep into the mire that you are not able to extricate yourself; and, indeed, the sooner the better. For in such a case you must seize the opportunity when it presents itself, concluding, that when the Lord vouchsafes the means, it is as though he opened the door for us; thus it behoves you thereupon to enter without further trifling or delay, for fear that it may be shut, while in the meantime we wrangle and debate about it.",

For I would not venture to be the author of a measure, authorizing one individual, without calling in others to deliberate with him, to attempt anything.

In the context of knowledge work, it turns out, autopilot schedules provide an effective means to contain tasks. Instead of setting regular times each week for completing school assignments, you can set times for accomplishing specific categories of regularly occurring tasks. A freelancer, for example, might schedule sending invoices for Monday morning, while a professor might schedule reviewing grant reports for Fridays, right after lunch. Once you get used to accomplishing a specific type of task at the same times on the same days, the overhead required for their execution plummets.",

Prioritize options that minimize this number. Most people focus on the difficulty of a project, or the total amount of time it might re-quire.

In a pull-based process, by contrast, each stage pulls in new work only when i's ready for it. At Broad, this pull methodology was implemented in a simple manner. Each stage maintained a tray to place the completed samples. The next stage would pull in new samples from this same tray. If the outgoing tray at a given stage began to fill, then the technicians filling it would slow down their work. In some cases, they would even offer their assistance to the next stage to help them catch up.

Crucially, each cycle is then followed by a two-week \"cooldown\" small issues and deciding what to tackle next. \"It's sometimes tempting to simply extend the cycles into the cooldown period to fit in more work,\" explains the Basecamp employee handbook. \"But the goal is to resist this temptation.\"",

This outdoor context pulled on rich threads from her past, resulting in a perception of work that was more alive, varied, and natural in its pace than if she had spent those exact same hours writing at a perfectly nice home office desk. This proposition asks you to similarly assess the context of your most important work through this poetic lens. By taking care in your choice of physical spaces and rituals, you can not only transform the experience of your efforts into something more interesting and sustainable, but more fully tap into your latent bril-liance.",

By calming their relational memory system, they could slow their perception of time and allow their attention to mold itself more completely around a singular pursuit. What's more important about these observations is that the aesthetics of their outside-the-home workspaces didn't really matter...What counted was their disconnection from the familiar. A citadel to creative concentration need not be a literal place. It just needs to be free of laundry baskets.",

Second, in doing so, ensure your rituals are sufficiently striking to effectively shift your mental state into something more supportive of your goals. The second principle of productivity asks that you work at a more natural pace. It's suitable that this suggestion about rituals closes this chapter, as there are few strategies that will more effectively transform your perception of time, pushing your experience away from anxiety and toward the more sublimely natural than to add a dash of poetic mystery to your efforts.",

Doing fewer things and working at a natural pace are both absolutely necessary components of this philosophy, but if those earlier principles are implemented on their own, without an accompanying obsession with quality, they might serve only to fray your relationship to work over time-casting your professional efforts as an imposition that you must tame.

We act wisely, therefore, if we adopt a reserved and somewhat skeptical attitude towards the characterizations of the new period that will dawn with peace. But that does not take away from the fact that there are some solid data on which we can certainly rely, and which guide our thinking and acting in a specific direction.",

Officially, education continues and schools remain open. But everyone understands that in reality, this is often a very sad state of affairs. Teachers, lecturers, and professors in the warring countries have been called up for service by the thousands and a considerable number have been killed or wounded. The pupils of the primary school were therefore, in numbers of seventy and more, grouped together in one class and entrusted to a single teacher, who can do little with such a large class and often cannot even maintain order in it. There is also a great lack of supervision and control by competent persons, because they too have for the most part been called up for service to the fatherland. ¹",

Through intellect, man had risen above the animal, had become a \"tool-making animal,\" and had learned to subject nature to himself. Thinking, which was born from life in the struggle for existence, also has its goal in that life; it is not a Selbstzweck (end in itself), but is useful and orders reality so that it promotes the well-being of man; representations, concepts, ideas are tools we use to master the world; truth and value are determined by biology. Accordingly, science, as is now said in leading circles, is no longer concerned with knowing an unknowable, metaphysical truth; but, just as it has emerged from life with all culture, so it is also subservient to life, and to be valued as one of the many weapons with which man has equipped himself in the struggle for existence.",

There is no objective, unchanging pedagogical ideal. The science of education is not an independent science developing according to its own idea and law, but it is in the closest connection with the culture of its time, follows the movement that it takes, and receives its ideal from the society in which it is rooted.",

What, for example, is one to do with the ideal of a harmonious development of all gifts and powers, if one seriously takes into account the hundreds of children in a primary school, who will enter practical life at about 13 or 14 years of age? With by far the most of them, one cannot and need not go further than making them useful members of society, and having them acquire the skills and abilities necessary for the exercise of their daily profession. \"Kulturbildung\" (cultural education) is therefore a grand word and an unattainable ideal; the educator who is content with \"Berufsbildung\" (vocational training) acts much more wisely and practically.",

Procreation is also actually a social function, which the community has to regulate and guide.

Parents cannot therefore do with their children as they wish, but are accountable and responsible to society for whether and how they raise them. If they are incapable or unwilling for this task, the state has the right to relieve them of parental authority or to remove them from it, and to take the children under its protection against them.

With the content of our knowledge, the number of those who wish to profit from it has also increased.

Modern schools already, fortunately, take much work off the hands of parents; but that would be even more the case with a still more rational and especially systematic organization of education, which would extend over the entire nation and make subjects like sociology, art history, music, and dance main subjects; at the same time, woman would then be delivered from her family slavery and soon also from her economic slavery. ²",

Leroy-Beaulieu, the French sociologist, rightly attributed the main cause of this evil in 1910 to the weakening of religious belief, and stated in 1913 that the only means to save the French people from ruin lay in a return to faith and to an ideal, self-sacrificing disposition.¹ As long as no other religious and moral principles prevail than those that flow from a mechanistic-evolutionary worldview, no conversion and no return to better morals can be expected.

M. de Jong, Zwolle, Ploegsma 1914, highlighted that good school education is of little use if the family is not also reformed. In Germany, Frans Walter cherishes the expectation that the war will promote the reform of the family, Die Wiedergeburt der deutschen Familie nach dem Weltkrieg, Innsbruck 1916.",

Sensation, perception, thinking, consciousness, feeling, will, free will, etc. are phenomena that do not exist spatially and therefore cannot be calculated quantitatively.

To that, as Möbius rightly says, all natural scientific endeavors change nothing, for indirect observations, measurements, experiments do give information about the \"how much,\" but not about the \"what.\"¹ And to all these objections is then added at the end the ethical consideration, whether it is permissible and thus also possible, to artificially arouse religious and ethical feelings or actions in the soul life, which precisely through this artificiality would lose their own character.²",

When empirical psychology entered the field of science and chose concrete psychic reality as the object of its investigation, it embarked on a path that had a beginning but no end. The so-called differential psychology can be endlessly specialized. Even if we leave aside plant and animal psychology, which have enjoyed great interest in recent years, the diversity in the psychic life of humans remains so endlessly vast that the research directed towards it knows no bounds. There are, of course, properties, both physical and mental, that are inherent to humans as such and are therefore found in all people, so that the right of general psychology cannot be disputed.

The aim is to make psychological research on the child in school subservient to teaching and education and to judge, based on empirical data, which is the best path to follow.

Stern with his: from the periphery to the center. A child is, after all, always, from its birth, a product of its own disposition, which includes all sorts of faculties, and many external factors acting upon it.

Therefore, neither Rousseau nor Pestalozzi is right; the child must be developed according to its own disposition and nature, but that development should be influenced and guided by the education of others. Education should thus be both \"naturgemäss\" (in accordance with nature), insofar as it should adapt to the student and his peculiar gifts; and also \"zielgemäss\" (goal-oriented), insofar as it does not leave the development of the student to chance or whim, but leads it in fixed paths and directs it towards a goal.",

Psychologie, p. 249 ff. ¹ This example, taken from Meumann, proves how easily the proponents of empirical psychology and pedagogy can yet abandon the foundation of empirical research and lose themselves in speculation. Indeed, as soon as one does not merely observe and state the phenomena, but connects them and wants to reduce them to a principle or law, empiricism fails and thought, and with it the religious or philosophical worldview, comes to speak. This applies particularly to all psychic phenomena, from perception, memory, attention, intellect, reason, emotion, will, etc. Hence, the empiricist psychologists today differ from each other on all these things just as much as the practitioners of general psychology did before. Agreement is now much more sought after than in previous times.",

Of course, the modesty that forbids saying more than can be justified is to be praised. But one may still ask whether the teacher and educator have so much to gain from the knowledge of them in practice. Certainly, the pedagogue needs general principles that can serve as a guide in the extensive field he has to cultivate; but Meumann promised at the beginning of his work that empirical pedagogy would enable the educator \"to be clear at all times about the justification of his pedagogical measures.\" It seems that with these general laws, this is still far from being the case, at least as far as with the educational principles that a former pedagogy offered him.",

Often he will, especially if he is an experienced teacher equipped with tact, hit the mark; but often he will also be at a loss with the complicated cases that occur in reality and will have to be content with a decision to the best of his knowledge. Almost nothing is changed in this if the teacher consults investigations that have been made into the developmental course of a special function, e.g., of memory, attention, imagination, thinking power, will, etc. For not only do the opinions on this vary widely; but also here he, by the nature of the case, only gets knowledge of some general laws that govern the development of those special functions, and thus he remains called upon to form a judgment according to those general laws about the particular case he faces in life.",

This assessment is based on a series of experiences, but also often on a total impression received at the first acquaintance. Of course, such an assessment is provisional; it is not infallible and may later be modified; a wise teacher will therefore try to account for the data on which his judgment of a particular pupil rests.

For it cannot be expected of the teacher in general that he be a psychologist and can conduct an independent and complete investigation into the individuality of each of his pupils. In any case, he needs guidance and help in this. And this must therefore be provided to him by the school psychologist, who has to ensure that individuality lists are established and maintained in every school; who must give the necessary instructions for the investigation of the pupils' properties, and who finally must collect, process, and profit from all this psychographic material for his advice.¹",

It is connected with the worldview already discussed above, that leadership in contemporary society has passed from blind, irrational nature into the hands of the intelligent, wise human; and that the whole of life in its depth and scope should be rationalized and socialized. Of socialization, however, there is, properly considered, no question at all here, because, as was just remarked, the whole change consists in the fact that the influence and decision are taken away from the parents and the person concerned himself and entrusted to a college of officials. And rationalization has its advantages in some cases, but also very certainly its disadvantages, especially when it concerns vocational choice.",

In this process, the moral qualities, which in themselves and for numerous professions have much greater value, will involuntarily recede and occupy only the second or third rank. One cannot easily control them, and is unable to judge the inner life, the disposition, and the heart. Thus one arrives at an intellectualization of social life, which in the present time should rather be counteracted than promoted, and one runs the risk of populating the higher schools more than is desirable, and of giving rise to an unfortunate learned proletariat; to which is added that in by far the most cases, one does no service to children by detaching them from the social milieu in which they were born and raised.",

For labor, so we are taught from the social-democratic side, first lets us know the essence of things, and must therefore be the foundation of teaching and education. In the schools, above all, labor education is necessary, which provides knowledge of the labor process and teaches how to handle tools. All children should therefore be formed mentally, but also physically and technically; they must all learn to work.¹ And what is demanded by social-democratic principles finds support in the developmental course of modern culture and is promoted by the practice of life. For in it, it became more and more apparent that what mattered were men and women whose arms and hands were not wrongly attached to their bodies, but who knew how to manage and could pave their own way.",

It is true that the learning school in former times, in connection with the whole character of the culture of that time, regarded the pupil as a disciple, who had to absorb the subject matter more or less passively. But the learning school too has moved with the times, has profited from the better insights of modern pedagogy, and is continuously extending its reforms to all subjects. And it can do this, because according to its own nature, it by no means excludes the self-activity and labor of the pupils, provided that by labor one does not exclusively think of manual labor.",

In reading, writing, arithmetic, and likewise in the teaching of language, history, geography, the children are by no means purely passive, nor do they need to be; although it is true that they cannot be active in the same degree and in the same way in the different subjects. Conversely, the pupils in a so-called work or labor school cannot be purely active; they too are pupils, must receive instruction, and need guidance. This applies, of course, in the first place to the ordinary subjects of education, which one, to know them, simply has to learn; but it also applies to actual manual labor, in which, if it is not to degenerate into useless tinkering, instruction and example, advice and guidance are indispensable.",

The differentiation in life should be respected in the school; not everything that is good is suitable for all people at all times. Therefore, Bebel's demand that every scholar and artist must perform physical labor for a part of the day is absurd,¹ unless by this labor a walk or some other relaxation is perhaps understood. The reverse, that a laborer should have to be a scholar or an artist, sufficiently shows the folly of the demand. And the appeal to great men like da Vinci, Cellini, and Lincoln, who excelled in so many respects, carries no weight for the average person.

And so, even within one's own country, thoughts differ greatly as to which subject should be in the foreground in school; Kerschensteiner, for example, emphasizes national education, Kabisch historical education, Foerster moral education.

My aim is to explain how and why a certain notion of the self has come to dominate the culture of the West, why this self finds its most obvious manifestation in the transformation of sexual mores, and what the wider implications of this transformation are and may well be in the future. Understanding the times is a precondition of responding appropriately to the times. And understanding the times requires a knowledge of the history that has led up to the present.

Practice diligently, always striving to hone key skills and to progress incrementally toward new levels of competence. Love the plateau. All worthwhile progress occurs through brief, thrilling leaps forward followed by long stretches during which you feel you’re going nowhere. Though it seems as if we’re making no progress, we are turning new behaviors into habits. Learning continues at the cellular level . . . if you follow good practice principles. Mastery is a journey, not a destination. True masters never believe they have attained mastery. There is always more to be learned and greater skill to be developed. (Location 6711)",
